        <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><Strong>Noodles:</Strong> This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</li>
            <li><strong>Parmesan:</strong> Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and Pepper:</strong> Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the fettuccine in lightly salted water until it's tender, yet still firm.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta in a colander, then return it to the pot.</li>
            <li>Mix butter, cheese, salt, and pepper into the cooked noodles until all the ingredients are evenly combined.</li>
        </ol>
